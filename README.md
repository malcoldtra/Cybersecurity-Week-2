## Notes

This lab was quite difficult for me mostly because I don't have much past experience with SQL. The intro lesson in Khan Academy was definitely helpful, but not enough to get me through the lab on my own. This was mostly because I needed to know what the errors being returned meant to take advantage of the "hints" being given to me/ I'm glad this lab helped me get familiar with SQL at least a little bit, but I have a lot to learn.

## Installation Instructions

Setup instructions can be found on the Week 2 Lab page.
